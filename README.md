## Task 4 - Basic Chatbot
- This is my **Third Task** for the **CodeAlpha Python-Programming Internship**.
  -  This is a simple rule-based chatbot in Python using if-elif, functions, loops, and input/output:

# 🤖 SimpleBot – Rule-Based Chatbot with GUI (Python)

SimpleBot is a basic, rule-based chatbot built using Python and Tkinter for its graphical interface. It mimics a simple conversation by matching user input to predefined rules. Designed for beginners, this project demonstrates core programming concepts like conditionals, loops, functions, and GUI design.

## 📌 Description

This chatbot allows users to type short messages (like "hello", "how are you", or "bye") and get predefined replies. It features a user-friendly graphical interface built with Python's Tkinter library. SimpleBot is a great starting point for understanding how early chatbots worked before AI/NLP models came into play.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- ✅ Implement a simple rule-based logic chatbot.
- ✅ Practice Python basics: `if-elif`, loops, input/output.
- ✅ Build a graphical interface with `Tkinter`.
- ✅ Handle user input gracefully.
- ✅ Provide clear feedback and end conversations politely.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🧠 **Predefined Responses**
  - Recognizes specific commands such as:
    - `hello`, `how are you`, `what is your name`, `tell me a joke`, `help`, `bye`.

- 🖼️ **Simple GUI using Tkinter**
  - Scrollable chat window
  - Entry box for user input
  - Send button and Enter key support

- ♻️ **Input Handling**
  - Case-insensitive matching
  - Trims unnecessary whitespace

- 🛑 **Auto-exit**
